<h3>The Man from Earth</h3>
<p>The Man from Earth is a 2007 American science fiction drama film directed by Richard Schenkman. It was written by Jerome Bixby, who conceived the screenplay in the early 1960s and completed it on his deathbed in April 1998.[2] It stars David Lee Smith as John Oldman, a departing university professor, who puts forth the notion that he is more than 14,000 years old. The entire film is set in and around Oldman's house during his farewell party and consists almost entirely of dialogue. The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.</p>

<p>The screenplay mirrors similar concepts of longevity which Bixby had introduced in "Requiem for Methuselah", a Star Trek episode he wrote which originally aired in 1969. The Man from Earth gained recognition in part for being widely distributed through Internet peer-to-peer networks, which raised its profile. The film was later adapted by Schenkman into a stage play.</p>

<h3>The Quick and the Dead</h3>
<p>The Quick and the Dead is a 1995 American revisionist Western film directed by Sam Raimi, and starring Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, and Leonardo DiCaprio. The screenplay was written by Simon Moore, but includes contributions from Joss Whedon.[5] The story focuses on "The Lady" (Stone), a gunfighter who rides into the frontier town of Redemption, controlled by John Herod (Hackman). The Lady joins a deadly dueling competition in an attempt to exact revenge for her father's death.</p>

<p>Simon Moore's script was purchased by Sony Pictures Entertainment in May 1993, and actress Sharon Stone signed on as both star and co-producer. Development was fast tracked after director Sam Raimi's hiring, and principal photography began in Old Tucson Studios in Arizona on November 21, 1993. The film was distributed by TriStar Pictures and was released in the United States on February 10, 1995, to a dismal box-office performance, receiving mixed reviews from critics. In later years, however, the film has earned critical praise, especially for the performances, direction, cinematography, and musical score, with some critics noting it as underrated in Raimi's catalog.[6][7][8][9]</p>
<h3>Vikram Vedha</h3>
<p>Vikram Vedha is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language neo-noir action thriller film directed and co-written by Pushkar–Gayathri and jointly produced by YNOT Studios, Friday Filmworks, Reliance Entertainment, T-Series Films and Jio Studios. A remake of the director duo's 2017 Tamil film of the same name, it is inspired by the Indian folktale Vetala Panchavimshati and stars Saif Ali Khan and Hrithik Roshan as the titular anti-heroes.[4] Radhika Apte, Rohit Saraf and Yogita Bihani play supporting roles. In the film, a police officer sets out to track down and kill a gangster. After voluntarily surrendering himself, the gangster tells the police officer three stories which change his perceptions of good and evil.</p>

<p>The film, announced in March 2018, marks Khan and Roshan's second collaboration, 20 years after having starred together in Na Tum Jaano Na Hum (2002). Production began in October 2021 and wrapped in June 2022, taking place mostly in Abu Dhabi and Lucknow. The film has music by Sam C. S. and Vishal–Shekhar, and cinematography by P. S. Vinod</p>
    
<p>Vikram Vedha was theatrically released worldwide on 30 September 2022 and received positive reviews from critics and audience, with praise directed towards the direction, cinematography, screenplay, background score and the performances (particularly Khan and Roshan), but underperformed at the box office.[5] At the 68th Filmfare Awards, it received eight nominations, including Best Actor (Roshan), and won Best Action.</p>
